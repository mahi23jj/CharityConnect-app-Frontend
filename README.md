# 🤲 Charity Connect (Frontend - Flutter)

A beautifully designed mobile app built with Flutter. The main goal of the app is to support verified but lesser-known charity organizations by creating a dedicated social media platform for them.

It helps users discover and support verified charities through donations, participation in campaigns, and regular updates. More importantly, the app ensures transparency and trust by verifying the authenticity of each charity organization.

## 🎯 Why I Built This App

In my community, I noticed that many small charity organizations do incredible work but lack digital visibility. also People want to help, but they don't always know where or how to give effectively there are a lot of scammers.

I built Charity Connect to bridge that gap — allowing users to easily discover, contact, and contribute to verified organizations using a clean mobile interface.
